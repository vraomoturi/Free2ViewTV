PROJECT NEWS (5/26/22)

The information about F2V TV that was located on the Free2View TV Project page on Blogger is no longer available and 
will be replaced with general streaming TV links and resources (including some pointers to Free2View TV resources just 
so that our Project can still easily be found). Due to some Terms of Service that I seemed to have violated with 
Google (don't ask me what, I am not counting on getting a clear answer), all the documentation and files about our 
Project will be found here, in this Github, instead.

You may download a full-color PDF flyer with all the live links and sources used by the Free2View TV Project from this 
Github repo. Download it here: https://github.com/Sphinxroot/Free2ViewTV/blob/main/FILES/Free2ViewTV_Flyer.pdf


Note: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. The Free2View TV Project is a non-profit, hobby based project,
who does its best to source these feeds from publicly available, official sources over the internet. A curated 
playlist is provided as a convenience to viewers who wish to have one source to meet all their online viewing needs 
and is not intended for commercial distribution or exhibition, nor to replace any official means of distribution 
such as online apps, websites and other streaming platforms. A curated playlist is also provided as a convenience 
when access to the official online distribution channels (website, apps, etc.) for these services are not available 
for the devices on which you wish to view their programming. Copyright infringement of live streams that are publicly
available online is not intended and will be promptly removed from this page or our curated playlists upon request

STREAMING APPS:

ATTENTION: As of December 2021, the original developer of Perfect Player has halted active development of
the app and has removed Perfect Player from app stores. Since Perfect Player is the preferred app for The
Free2View TV Project's curated lists, the app will be available through our own distribution services.
In order to install APK files on your Android device, your device must be set to Developer Mode, which will allow
you to 'sideload' apps (install apps) that don't come from the official app store, such as Perfect Player on this blog.
Don’t let this scare you. It is a setting that is very easy to change, still keeps your Android TV device relatively
secure, and being in Developer Mode won’t really affect your day-to-day operation of your device at all. In fact,
after you’ve sideloaded the apps you want, you can simply turn developer options off if it makes you feel more
comfortable.

Do the following: Go to your Chromecast settings > about > Android TV OS build and click the center button on
your remote while you have the build number highlighted. After a handful of clicks, you’ll see a countdown and
then a message that says “You are now a developer!” That’s it!

Next, allow installation from unknown sources: Stay in the settings menu and head to the Apps > Security &
Restrictions > Unknown sources and flip the switch that will allow your device to install apps from unknown
sources. Again, you can turn all of this off at the end of this whole process (after you have what you want installed)
if this makes you feel unsecured.

Now, click here to get Perfect Player APK from our Github repository and download it to your computer.
Once all of this is done, now you will need to install a file explorer app on your device that will allow you to
download Perfect Player (or any APK file from any sources). I prefer an app that is available through the Google
Play Store called X-Plore File Manager. The reason why I prefer this app is because you can link your Google
Drive account and download files from your GDrive directly to your Google TV device. So, from this blog,
download the APK file for Perfect Player to your PC, then upload the file to a folder in your Google Drive (all
Google gmail accounts come with Google Drive, so get a gmail account if you don't already, it's free and comes
with 15GB of cloud storage space). On your Google TV device, open X-Plore File Manager and navigate to
WebStorage (on the right pane), then to your Google Drive folder that has the uploaded APK file. Click on the
APK file and your device will start downloading the file. Accept all the prompts to install the APK and that's it!
Now that you have Perfect Player installed, continue below!

PERFECT PLAYER:

EASY SETUP USING PERFECT PLAYER: Here is a very easy way to get Free2View TV on any Android /
Android TV device using the Perfect Player app:

The first thing you will do is download the file below to a USB stick if your device supports USB, or you can use a
cloud storage app such as one described in the previous section of this document (this is a backup file for Perfect
Player that is already pre-configured with the initial settings and remote URL's for Free2View TV and its EPG
sources).

Click the link to download the file and save it to a USB stick (or directly to the Downloads folder of your device,
or directly to a cloud folder that you will access from your file explorer app on your device):

Backup 12/12/21 (Master list)
https://od.lk/s/MF8yNTU3OTcyNDBf/20211212_F2V-Master.ppbck

Backup 12/12/21 (Master NSFW list)
https://od.lk/s/MF8yNTU3OTcyNDRf/20211212_NSFW.ppbck

Perfect Player APK apps and backup files are also available to download from our Github mirror:
https://github.com/Sphinxroot/Free2ViewTV/tree/main/PLAYER
1. Go to the Android Store on your compatible streaming device, search and install Perfect Player.*
2. Once you launch Perfect Player, you will be met with a playback menu in which you will see the Settings icon
(the gear wheel at the furthest right of the menu.)
3. Click on the Settings gear wheel icon, then click Defaults.
4. Click on Restore Settings and navigate to your USB stick (or the Downloads folder) from your device and select
the '[current].ppbck' file.
5. Perfect Player will load the backup file, close down, then relaunch with the new settings.

* Download Perfect Player apk standalone app if you cannot get it through your Android app store:
August 2021: Get the latest version of Perfect Player as it fixes issues of the app crashing after a recent Fire TV
update!! Get Perfect Player standalone APK from the official website:
http://niklabs.com/news/

Once Perfect Player relaunches, the basic setup of Free2View TV will be complete and you can customize your
experience as you wish (set up Favorites, tweak other playback settings, etc.). You can then create your own
backup (via Backup Settings option in Perfect Player) just in case something goes wrong later on and you need to
restore your last backup.

FireTV (FireStick) owners: Here is a guide on how to install Perfect Player on your devices. You can also use
cloud storage services / app to download PP backup files to your device, or manually type all the sources into
Perfect Player's settings once the app is installed.
